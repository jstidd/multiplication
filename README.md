multiplication
==============

Help a child memorize the multiplication table.

The Concept
-----------

As I watch my children try to memorize muliplication I constantly see them trying to figure out the answers. I thought the idea was to memorize it so you don't have to figure it out each time. 

No more figuring it out each time - just look it up and move on. Do it enough times and you will memorize it. The time the child wastes in fuguring out 9x8 they could have had practice on more drills.

Platform
--------

I haven't decided what platform to build this on. 

Step One
--------

I'm going to start simply by making in jQuery. 

The Future
----------

I would like add a database to track statistics. My kids love earning stuff in their video games. I thought it might be a good idea to have something to earn, and a character to give it to. 

Please Help
-----------

I appreciate any help I can get to make this a great tool for everychild (or adult) that needs to memorize the mulitiplcation table.


Thanks, 

Jason Stidd
